/*% HYSTHRESH - Hysteresis thresholding
%
% Usage: bw = hysthresh(im, T1, T2)
%
% Arguments:
%             im  - image to be thresholded (assumed to be non-negative)
%             T1  - upper threshold value
%             T2  - lower threshold value
%
% Returns:
%             bw  - the thresholded image (containing values 0 or 1)
%
% Function performs hysteresis thresholding of an image.
% All pixels with values above threshold T1 are marked as edges
% All pixels that are adjacent to points that have been marked as edges
% and with values above threshold T2 are also marked as edges. Eight
% connectivity is used.
%
% It is assumed that the input image is non-negative
%
% Peter Kovesi          December 1996  - Original version
%                       March    2001  - Speed improvements made (~4x)

%
% A stack (implemented as an array) is used to keep track of all the
% indices of pixels that need to be checked.
% Note: For speed the number of conditional tests have been minimised
% This results in the top and bottom edges of the image being considered to
% be connected.  This may cause some stray edges to be propagated further than 
% they should be from the top or bottom.
